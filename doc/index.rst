Documentation
=============

Python package **teneva** (**ten**\ sor **eva**\ luation) provides a very compact implementation of basic operations in the tensor-train (TT) format, including TT-SVD, TT-ALS, TT-ANOVA, TT-CROSS, TT-truncate, "add", "mul", "norm", "mean", Chebyshev interpolation, etc. This approach can be used for approximation of multidimensional arrays and multivariate functions, as well as for efficient implementation of various operations of linear algebra in the low rank format. The core program code is organized within a functional paradigm and it is very easy to learn and use. Each function has detailed documentation and various usage demos.
