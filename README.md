# teneva


## Description

This python package, named **teneva** (**ten**sor **eva**luation), provides a very compact implementation of basic operations in the tensor-train (TT) format, including TT-SVD, TT-ALS, TT-ANOVA, TT-cross, TT-truncate, Chebyshev interpolation, "add", "mul", "norm", "mean", "sample", etc. Our approach can be used for approximation of multidimensional arrays and multivariate functions, as well as for efficient implementation of various operations of linear algebra in the low rank TT-format. The program code is organized within a functional paradigm and it is very easy to learn and use. Each function has detailed documentation and various usage demos.


## Installation

> Current version "0.14.8".

The package can be installed via pip: `pip install teneva` (it requires the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language of the version 3.8 or 3.9). It can be also downloaded from the repository [teneva](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva) and installed by `python setup.py install` command from the root folder of the project.


## Documentation, examples and tests

- See detailed [online documentation](https://teneva.readthedocs.io) for a description of each function and various numerical examples for each function.

- See the jupyter notebooks in the `demo` folder of the repository [teneva](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva) with brief description and demonstration of the capabilities of each function from the `teneva` package, including the basic examples of using the TT-ALS, TT-ANOVA and TT-cross for approximation of the multivariable functions. Note that all examples from this folder are also presented in the online documentation.

- See [changelog.md](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva/blob/master/changelog.md) file with a description of the changes made for new package versions and [workflow.md](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva/blob/master/workflow.md) file with a description of the rules we use to work on the code (draft!).

- Run all the tests (based on the `unittest` framework) from the root of the repository [teneva](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva) as `python test/test.py` (draft!).
